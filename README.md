## AWS Services Used
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- AWS IAM
- Amazon RDS
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon CloudWatch
- Amazon SNS
- AWS CloudTrail

## Architecture Summary
- EC2 handles compute workloads
- S3 stores objects and backups
- RDS manages relational data
- Lambda executes serverless logic
- IAM enforces secure access
- CloudWatch monitors performance
- SNS sends alert notifications
- CloudTrail audits AWS activity

## Outcome
Designed and deployed a cloud infrastructure using Amazon EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, and Lambda, with monitoring via CloudWatch, alerts using SNS, and auditing through CloudTrail.
